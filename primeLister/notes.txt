Make a variable for the number we want to check up to
prompt the user to fill the variable.
Make an array for the primes.
Loop from 1  to the number.
make an array for divisble numbers.
    loop from 1 to the iterator above (inclusive) modulating them.
    if we can modulate without a remainder add it to the array for divisble numbers.
check if the divisble array is 2 long if so add the number to the primes array.
iterate through until you have done up to the number and log the listof primes.
